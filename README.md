# occultus
occultus is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate.

Unlike traditional messaging apps, occultus doesn't rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices. 

If the Internet's down, occultus can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, occultus can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.
